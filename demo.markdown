# Eric Webb (webmonarch.github.com)

I am a technology generalist with a soft spot for the web, automation, and operations.  My LinkedIn profile has all the pleasantries of my professional experience, but if you want substance, you are in the right place.  My work that is open sourced is right here on GitHub.

If your needs match my skill and interest, I am available for part-time contract work.  Either reach out through LinkedIn or email opensource@collectivegenius.net.
